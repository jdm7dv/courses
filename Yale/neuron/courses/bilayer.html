<h2> Simulation </h2>

<h3> Representation </h3>
<pre>
	create soma
</pre>

<h3> Using the representation </h3>
<a href="bilayer/bilayer.hoc">Run NEURON with above spec.</a>

<h2> Exercises </h2>

1. Run it.

<p>
Double the duration and halve the amplitude (injected charge is constant).
<ul>
Notes:
<li>
Select Show / Parameters in the PointProcessManager window to view
the field editors.
<li>
Multiplying a field editor value by 2 can be done
by typing *2 &lt;return&gt; at the end of the value. Divide by 2 by typing
/2 &lt;return&gt;.<br>
<li>
The mouse cursor must be in the panel that contains the field editor. 
</ul>

<p>
Return the duration and amplitude to their default values (click in
the checkmark box with left mouse button).<br>
Halve the duration and double the amplitude.

<p>
2. Insert passive conductance channels by clicking on the "pas" checkbox
in the "SingleCompartment" window and repeat part 1.
<br>
Notice that the voltage tends toward -70 mV, 
which is the default reversal potential for the passive channel. 
This reflects the fact that the initial condition v = 0 
is not the steady state for this model. 

<p>
In the "RunControl" set the Init field editor to -70 and repeat the run.

<blockquote>
The graphs can be automatically
rescaled to show the curves by invoking the Graph menu with the right
mouse button and selecting the "View=Plot" menu item.
</blockquote>

<p>
3. Change the stimulus amplitude to 1A (1e9 nA) and run.
Rescale the graphs to see the result.
<br> 
The model is a poor representation of the physical system in this case.

<p>
4. Change the stimulus duration to 0.01 ms.
<br>
The simulation is a poor representation of the model in this case

<p> 
Change the number of Points plotted/ms to 100 and dt to 0.01 ms 
and repeat the run.

<p>
5. Increase the amplitude to 1e4 nA, cut the duration to 1e-5 ms, 
increase Points plotted/ms to 1e5, and let 'er rip.  
<br>
After a few seconds of eternity, stop the simulation.

<p>
Select "Use variable dt" and try again.

<p>
When you're done, use "NEURONMainMenu / File / Quit" to exit NEURON.
