<h3>Note:</h3>
(1-12) will also work but (1e-12) will cause a strange problem having
to do with the fact that e is an electronic charge of
1.602192e-19 coulomb. This is shameful but
everywhere else (1e12) is treated as a number except when it appears
in a units combination. ie (1e-6 m) must be written (1-6 m) or (micro m)
or (micro-m). The rule is that the UNITS block uses the unix units program
syntax exclusively
but there exists a (1e12) convenience exception outside the UNITS block.
